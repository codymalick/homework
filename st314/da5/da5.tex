\section*{Part I}
\subsection*{a}
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{scatterplot}\\
There seems to be a moderately strong, positive, linear relationship between
City CO2
emmisions and Highway CO2 emmisions. There are a few positive outliers near the
center of the scatterplot, and a balanced number of positive and negative outliers
near the top right of the plot.


\subsection*{b}
The correlation coefficient:\\
$r=.9418$\\
The coeffcient measures the linear association strength between two quantative
variables. In this case, it is showing there is a fairly strong linear relationship
between city CO2 emissions and highway CO2 emissions.

\subsubsection*{iii}
The relationship between City CO2 emmisions and Highway CO2 looks to be convincingly
strong, with a correlation of .94. As City CO2 increases, highway CO2 also increases.
The relationship is modeled by the least squares regression equation:\\
$average emissions = 66.325 + .5771x$\\
Average city CO2 emissions is a significant predictor for Highway CO2 emissions
(t test stat = 81.5, df=846, and p-value .00000025).\\
The null hypothesis is rejected at a significant level of .01. The data supports
the assumptions that increasing city emissions may increase highway CO2 emissions.
The highway CO2 emissions are expected to increase .5771 for every 1 City CO2 emission
increase. 

\subsection*{e}
The slop shows how much the highway CO2 levels rise with the increase of city
CO2 levels. With a 99\% confidence interval from .5588 to .5954. That means
with 99\% confidence, we believe that the highway CO2 emissions increase
by .5771 for each 1 increase in City CO2 emissions.
